KLENGTH-BELLMAN-FORD(G, s, k)
  for each node v ∈ G.V
    v.d = ∞
  s.d=0
  for i= 1 to k 
    T={}
    for each edge(u, v)∈G.E
      if v.d > u.d+w(u, v)
        T[v] =u.d+w(u, v)
    for each v ∈ T
      v.d=T[v]
      
Time analysis: Initialization takes O(V) time. Both checking and updating take O(E) time, and there are k iterations. So total time is O(kE+V).
